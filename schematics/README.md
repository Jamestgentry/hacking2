# schematics
The schematics in EAGLE CAD format that you will find here are provided, in-case they are useful as a starting point for your own designs.

Many of them are somewhat ad-hoc as they were made, specifically to produce the figures for the book and some use parts where the symbols and packages are not consistent.

Use them at your own risk.
